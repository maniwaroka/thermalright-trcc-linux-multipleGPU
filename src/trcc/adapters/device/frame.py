"""
Transport-layer ABC hierarchy for all USB device types.

Two categories of devices plug into DeviceProtocol (factory.py adapter layer):
  - Frame devices (SCSI, HID, Bulk) send image frames to LCD screens.
  - LED devices send RGB color data to LED controllers.

Both share a universal contract (UsbDevice: handshake + close), then
specialize with their data-sending method.

Hierarchy:
    UsbDevice (ABC) — handshake() + close()
    ├── FrameDevice (ABC) — + send_frame()
