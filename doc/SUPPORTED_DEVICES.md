| VID:PID | Protocol | Display | Products |
|---------|----------|---------|----------|
| 87CD:70DB | SCSI | Full LCD | Older LCD screens |
| 87AD:70DB | Bulk | Full LCD | GrandVision 360 AIO, Mjolnir Vision 360 |

| 0416:8001 | HID | LED + segment / Full LCD | Digital series + many Vision products |

The exact product model is identified after a USB handshake. The device responds with PM (product model) and SUB bytes that tell the app which product it is and whether to show the LCD or LED control panel.

## How to Help Test

If you own any of the untested devices above and run Linux:

1. Install: `pip install trcc-linux pyusb`
2. Run the setup wizard: `trcc setup` (checks deps, installs udev rules, desktop entry)
3. Unplug/replug USB cable
4. Run detection: `trcc detect --all`
5. Try the GUI: `trcc gui` (HID devices are auto-detected)
6. Report what you see at https://github.com/Lexonight1/thermalright-trcc-linux/issues
