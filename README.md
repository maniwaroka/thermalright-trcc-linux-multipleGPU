# TRCC Linux

> **Looking for testers!** We need **Linux**, **Windows**, **macOS**, and **BSD** testers. If you have a Thermalright LCD or LED device on any platform, grab the latest [release](https://github.com/Lexonight1/thermalright-trcc-linux/releases/latest) and [let us know how it goes](https://github.com/Lexonight1/thermalright-trcc-linux/issues) — run `trcc report` and paste the output in an issue. Every test report helps, even if nothing works yet!

> **Solo hobbyist project** — built in my spare time, one device, no corporate backing. Just a Linux user who got tired of waiting for Thermalright to support us. If something breaks, please be patient — I do this for free because I like helping people. If this project helps you, consider [buying me a beer](https://buymeacoffee.com/Lexonight1) 🍺 or [Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/lexonight1) ☕

> Huge thanks to **[@javisaman](https://github.com/javisaman)**, **[@Xentrino](https://github.com/Xentrino)**, **[@loosethoughts19-hash](https://github.com/loosethoughts19-hash)**, **[@Mr-Renegade](https://github.com/Mr-Renegade)**, **[@Reborn627](https://github.com/Reborn627)**, **[@knappstar](https://github.com/knappstar)**, and **[@woebygon](https://github.com/woebygon)** for the beers — you guys are legends.

Native Linux port of the Thermalright LCD Control Center (Windows TRCC 2.1.2). Control and customize the LCD displays and LED segment displays on Thermalright CPU coolers, AIO pump heads, and fan hubs — entirely from Linux.

> **This project wouldn't exist without our testers.** I only own one device. Every supported device in this list works because someone plugged it in, ran `trcc report`, and told me what broke. 32 testers helped us go from "SCSI only" to full C# feature parity with 6 USB protocols, 16 FBL resolutions, and 12 LED styles. Open source at its best — see [Contributors](#contributors) below.

> Unofficial community project, not affiliated with Thermalright. Built with [Claude](https://claude.ai) (AI) for protocol reverse engineering and code generation, guided by human architecture decisions and logical assessment.

## Install

### Native packages (recommended)

Pre-built packages are available for every major distro. No pip, no venv, no PEP 668 headaches — just download and install like any other app. Every release is built automatically from source using [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/Lexonight1/thermalright-trcc-linux/actions/workflows/release.yml) — the build logs are public so anyone can verify what went in.

> Not sure which distro you're running? Open a terminal and type `cat /etc/os-release` — the `ID` line tells you.

**Fedora / openSUSE / Nobara:**
```bash
sudo dnf install https://github.com/Lexonight1/thermalright-trcc-linux/releases/latest/download/trcc-linux-8.6.4-1.fc43.noarch.rpm
```

**Ubuntu 24.04+ / Debian 13+ / Mint 22+ / Pop!_OS 24.04+ / Zorin 17+:**
```bash
curl -LO https://github.com/Lexonight1/thermalright-trcc-linux/releases/latest/download/trcc-linux_8.6.4-1_all.deb
sudo dpkg -i trcc-linux_8.6.4-1_all.deb
sudo apt-get install -f    # pulls in any missing dependencies
```

> **Older versions** (Ubuntu 22.04, Mint 21.x, etc.) don't have `python3-pyside6` and other deps in their repos. Use `pipx` instead — see [PyPI install](#pypi) below.

**Arch / CachyOS / Manjaro / EndeavourOS / Garuda:**
```bash
curl -LO https://github.com/Lexonight1/thermalright-trcc-linux/releases/latest/download/trcc-linux-8.6.4-1-any.pkg.tar.zst
sudo pacman -U trcc-linux-8.6.4-1-any.pkg.tar.zst
```

**NixOS** — add to your `flake.nix` inputs:
```nix
{
  inputs.trcc-linux.url = "github:Lexonight1/thermalright-trcc-linux";

  # In your system configuration:
  programs.trcc-linux.enable = true;
}
```
Then run `sudo nixos-rebuild switch`.

**Step 3:** Unplug and replug the USB cable, or reboot (this reloads the device permissions).

**Step 4:** Launch the app:
```bash
trcc gui
```

That's it! If your device isn't detected, run `trcc detect --all` to see what's connected, or `trcc report` and [open an issue](https://github.com/Lexonight1/thermalright-trcc-linux/issues/new) with the output.

### Windows (experimental)

Download `trcc-8.6.4-setup.exe` from the [latest release](https://github.com/Lexonight1/thermalright-trcc-linux/releases/latest) and run the installer. It installs both the GUI and CLI:

- **TRCC** shortcut in Start Menu — launches the GUI
- **`trcc`** command in Command Prompt/PowerShell — CLI access (installer adds it to PATH)

> Requires Windows 10 or 11. For GPU sensors (hotspot temp, memory junction temp, voltage), [LibreHardwareMonitor](https://github.com/LibreHardwareMonitor/LibreHardwareMonitor) must be running — trcc reads its sensors automatically. Run as Administrator for full hardware access.

### macOS (experimental)

Download `trcc-8.6.4-macos.dmg` from the [latest release](https://github.com/Lexonight1/thermalright-trcc-linux/releases/latest), open the DMG, and drag **TRCC** to Applications.

> Requires macOS 11+. Install `libusb` first: `brew install libusb`. LCD devices using SCSI (most models) need `sudo` to detach the kernel driver — HID devices work without root. On Apple Silicon Macs, sensor reading requires `sudo` for `powermetrics` access.

### FreeBSD (experimental)

```bash
pkg install py311-pip libusb py311-pyusb py311-hid
pip install trcc-linux
trcc gui
```

> SCSI devices use `/dev/pass*` via `camcontrol` (part of base system). CPU temp requires `kldload coretemp` (Intel) or `kldload amdtemp` (AMD). HID devices work via hidapi. Run as root for full hardware access.

### Verify your download

Every release includes a `SHA256SUMS.txt` file. Download it from the same release page, then:

```bash
cd ~/Downloads
sha256sum -c SHA256SUMS.txt --ignore-missing
```

If you see `OK` next to your package — it's clean. Source code is GPL-3.0, fully auditable — no binaries, no obfuscation, no telemetry.

### PyPI

Best option for older distros (Ubuntu 22.04, Mint 21.x, Debian 11/12) or if you prefer Python packaging.

```bash
# Install system dependencies first
sudo apt install pipx libusb-1.0-0 sg3-utils p7zip-full libxcb-cursor0  # Debian/Ubuntu/Mint
sudo dnf install pipx libusb-1.0.0 sg3_utils p7zip                      # Fedora

# Install trcc-linux
pipx install trcc-linux
trcc setup        # interactive wizard — udev rules, desktop entry
```

Then **unplug and replug the USB cable** and run `trcc gui`.

> `pipx` not installed? `sudo apt install pipx` (Debian/Ubuntu), `sudo dnf install pipx` (Fedora), `sudo pacman -S python-pipx` (Arch). See the **[Install Guide](doc/GUIDE_INSTALL.md)** for your distro.

### Automatic (git clone)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Lexonight1/thermalright-trcc-linux.git
cd thermalright-trcc-linux
sudo ./install.sh
```

Detects your distro, installs system packages, Python deps, udev rules, and desktop shortcut.

### Supported distros

Fedora, Nobara, Ubuntu, Debian, Mint, Pop!_OS, Zorin, elementary OS, Arch, Manjaro, EndeavourOS, CachyOS, Garuda, openSUSE, Void, Gentoo, Alpine, NixOS, Bazzite, Aurora, Bluefin, SteamOS (Steam Deck).

> **`trcc: command not found`?** Open a new terminal — pip installs to `~/.local/bin` which needs a new shell session to appear on PATH.

> See the **[Install Guide](doc/GUIDE_INSTALL.md)** for distro-specific instructions and troubleshooting.

### Something not working?

**[Open a GitHub issue](https://github.com/Lexonight1/thermalright-trcc-linux/issues/new)** — that's the only place I see bug reports. I don't monitor Reddit, forums, or Discussions. Run `trcc report`, paste the output, and I'll get back to you.

### Have an untested device?

Run `trcc report` and [paste the output in an issue](https://github.com/Lexonight1/thermalright-trcc-linux/issues/new) — takes 30 seconds. See the **[full list of devices that need testers](doc/TESTERS_WANTED.md)**.

### REST API

Start the API server and control your devices remotely:

```bash
trcc serve                    # Start on http://localhost:9876
trcc serve --port 8080        # Custom port
trcc serve --tls              # HTTPS with auto-generated self-signed cert
trcc serve --host 0.0.0.0     # Listen on all interfaces (LAN access)
```

43 endpoints covering devices, display, LED, themes, and system metrics. Use `trcc api` to list all endpoints.

```bash
# Examples with curl
curl http://localhost:9876/devices              # List devices
curl -X POST http://localhost:9876/display/send \
  -F "file=@wallpaper.png"                     # Send image
curl -X POST http://localhost:9876/led/color \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"color": "#ff0000"}'                    # Set LED color
```

## Features

| Category | What you get |
|----------|-------------|
| **GUI** | Full PySide6 desktop app — theme browser, video player, overlay editor, LED control panel, 38 languages |
| **CLI** | 50 commands — `trcc gui`, `trcc send`, `trcc video`, `trcc led-color`, `trcc screencast`, and more |
| **REST API** | 43 endpoints — control everything remotely, build integrations, automate your setup |
| **Themes** | Local, cloud, and masks — carousel mode, export/import as `.tr` files, custom mask upload with X/Y positioning, 5 starters + 120 masks per resolution |
| **Media** | Video/GIF playback, video trimmer, image cropper, screen cast (X11 + Wayland) |
| **Overlay Editor** | Text, sensors, date/time overlays — font picker, dynamic scaling, color picker |
| **Hardware Sensors** | 77+ sensors — CPU/GPU temp, fan speed, power, usage — customizable dashboard |
| **LED Control** | 12 LED styles, zone carousel, breathing/rainbow/static/wave modes, per-zone color |
| **Display** | 16 resolutions (240x240 to 1920x462), 0/90/180/270 rotation, 3 brightness levels |
| **Multi-device** | Per-device config, auto-detect, multi-device with device selection |
| **Security** | udev rules, polkit policy, SELinux support, no root required after setup |

**Under the hood**: 109 source files, ~40K lines of Python, 5045 tests across 60 test files in 9 directories. Hexagonal architecture with strict dependency injection — GUI, CLI, and API all talk to the same core services. 6 USB protocols reverse-engineered from the Windows C# app.

### What we do better than Windows TRCC

- **38 languages** — Windows has 10 (baked into PNGs). We render text at runtime, community can add more
- **CLI + REST API** — Windows is GUI-only. We have 50 CLI commands and 43 API endpoints for automation
- **Custom mask upload** — upload your own PNG overlay, position with X/Y controls, saved to `~/.trcc-user/`
- **No admin required** — udev rules handle permissions. Windows needs "Run as Administrator"
- **Open source** — read the code, fix bugs, add features. Windows TRCC is closed-source .NET
- **Screencast on Wayland** — Windows can't do that either
- **Hexagonal architecture** — GUI, CLI, and API share the same core. No feature lag between interfaces

### 38-Language GUI (i18n)

The Windows TRCC app ships 10 languages by baking translated text into separate PNG background images — 129 PNGs just for panel labels. We replaced all of that with a runtime i18n system: language-neutral background PNGs + QLabel text overlays rendered from `core/i18n.py`. Switching languages updates every label instantly — no restart, no extra files.

**Supported languages:** Simplified Chinese, Traditional Chinese, English, German, Russian, French, Portuguese, Japanese, Spanish, Korean, Italian, Dutch, Polish, Turkish, Arabic, Hindi, Thai, Vietnamese, Indonesian, Czech, Swedish, Danish, Norwegian, Finnish, Hungarian, Romanian, Ukrainian, Greek, Hebrew, Malay, Bengali, Urdu, Farsi, Tagalog, Tamil, Punjabi, Swahili, Burmese

Adding a new language is one dict entry per string in `core/i18n.py` — no PNG editing, no asset pipeline. Community translations welcome.

## Architecture

```
src/trcc/
├── core/           # Models, enums, domain constants — zero I/O
├── services/       # Business logic — pure Python, no framework deps
├── adapters/       # USB device protocols (SCSI, HID, Bulk, LY, LED)
├── qt_components/  # PySide6 GUI (themes, video, overlay, LED, sensors)
├── cli/            # Typer CLI — 50 commands across 8 modules
├── api/            # FastAPI REST API — 43 endpoints across 7 modules
├── conf.py         # Settings singleton
└── assets/         # GUI images, desktop entry, polkit policy, systemd service
```

**Hexagonal architecture** — GUI, CLI, and API are interchangeable adapters over the same core services. Adding a new interface (Android app, Home Assistant plugin) means writing a new adapter, not touching business logic.

**6 USB protocols** reverse-engineered from the Windows C# app:

| Protocol | Transport | Devices |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| SCSI | SG_IO ioctl | Frozen Warframe, Elite Vision, AK/AX120, PA120, LC1-5 |
| HID Type 2 | pyusb interrupt | Trofeo Vision, Assassin Spirit, AS/BA120, Frozen Warframe SE/PRO |
| HID Type 3 | pyusb interrupt | TARAN ARMS |
| Bulk | pyusb bulk | GrandVision 360, Mjolnir Vision 360, Wonder Vision Pro 360, Frozen Warframe Pro |
| LY | pyusb bulk (chunked) | Trofeo Vision 9.16 LCD |
| LED | pyusb HID | All LED segment display devices (12 styles) |
